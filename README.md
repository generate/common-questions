# common-questions [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/common-questions.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/common-questions)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/generate/common-questions.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/generate/common-questions)

> An object of questions commonly used by project generators or when initializing projects. Questions can be overridden, updated or extended.

This is currently formatted to work with [question-store](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/question-store), but this will probably be generalized so it can work with [inquirer](https://github.com/sboudrias/Inquirer.js), [question-cache](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/question-cache) etc.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i common-questions --save
```

## Usage

```js
var commonQuestions = require('common-questions');

var Questions = require('question-store');
var questions = new Questions();

var obj = commonQuestions();

for (var key in obj) {
  questions.visit(key, obj[key]);
}
```
